Over the past few months, a small voice in my head has been nagging me. I have been successfully ignoring it until it has become too loud to bear. It says: **"You don't really understand how neural networks work!"**.

I guess it's finally time to do something about it. I have decided to build a neural network from scratch using only numpy. Why, you say? The reasons are two-fold:

1. It will force me to deeply understand the concepts and math associated with a neural network.
2. It will force me to learn numpy properly -- once and for all.

I will write about my daily check-ins here in the hope of keeping me accountable and documenting my progress.
