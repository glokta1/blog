- Trust yourself
- "You don't have to be ready, you just have to go."
- the human brain is the most impressive piece of engineering ever created. Great at adapting, coming up with solutions on the fly. Trust your brain.
- Dive into the deep end. You'll trip and won't be able to breathe, it'll feel horrible but every time your brain has learned a little.
- Instinct
  - developed through lots and lots of repetition
  - all athletes at the highest levels are unable to explain how they do certain things.
  - Ayrton Senna: _"And suddenly I realized that I was no longer driving the car consciously. I was driving it by a kind of instinct, only I was in a different dimension."_ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeFqsWWG1qE

- Advice is consumed passively. Almost never effective in changing behavior.
  - Why? Only surface level comprehension of the speaker. Experience matters.
- Behavior won't change unless it touches the heart. Feeling it, not processing it.
- Fundamentally, taking action requires courage. The courage to push past the fear, uncertainty and get the ball rolling.
