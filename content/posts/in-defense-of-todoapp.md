title: "(DRAFT) In defense of the Todo App"
draft: false
---

Thesis: Basic projects (like the todo app) are great for learning because they strip out all the complexity and enable a laser-like focus on the fundamentals. These fundamentals form the building blocks for 95% of real-world applications. 

- A lot of people come into the field inspired by fancy things that people have built and they want to build the next million dollar startup or idea.
- I was repulsed by the idea of working on a basic, overdone project like a Todo App or a calculator or a clone of a popular website. I wanted to build something truly useful and revolutionary
	- But to build something like that, I needed to work on the basic stuff. And my ego wouldn't let me. So I kept toiling and getting frustrated when, in the midst of working on my next Facebook, I would realize I didn't know where to begin. There were too many moving parts. I'd ignore that voice, try to push through it, get frustrated and eventually move on to another project. This went on for several months before I discovered The Odin Project.
- Fundamentally, it is an ego issue. You feel working on these "basic" projects is beneath you.
